Stocks


List of stocks:
* S&P 500
* Amazon
* Coca Cola
* Starbucks
* Toyota
* Bank of America


Holidays:
* Valentine’s Day
* 4th of July
* Thanksgiving/Black Friday
* Christmas
* +/- 2 business days (include the holiday if applicable, to make it 5 business days)


Date range:
* Test with small data set (1 week) and extend from there
* Test with a longer time frame after (5 years?)
   * 2015-2020


What to look for:
* Average Daily Percentage change of the data
* Trends (code?)
   * Compare p-values ANOVA test (and other tests)
      * (Sukhjit)
   * Graph
      * Date vs. Closing Price for whole time period (Paul)
         * Line?
         * X is one column (date) vs. Price (y-value)
      * Q1 (x-axis) vs. Average Daily Percent change (Paul)
         * Bar graph
            * Adding error bars (st dev) – possible extra addition
            * Coloring conditionally?
         * Box and whiskers plot
            * 25th, median, 75th, outliers, average are shown
         * Other plots? Dot plot?
      * Holidays (x-axis) vs. Average Daily Percent change (Sukhjit)
         * See how to select only the 10 day range
         * Bar graph
         * Line graph zoomed into 10 day range around holiday
      * (Average percentage change) ~ (whether it’s a holiday or not) + (which quarter we are in)
         * Challenge: Will this predict something?
         * Compare the regressions on both variables
      * Function:
         * User inputs file from website
         * And, then it analyzes that file
         * Spits out table and average daily percent change
         * Tiem vs. price for x period


Outline:
1. Read in from a file, data
2. Keep the useful information (date, closing) + add column (daily percent change for each row)
3. Quarterly division and graphing
4. Holiday division and graphing
5. ANOVA analysis – applied to the data after grouping
6. Goal: Code is ideally done by Sunday, move on to thinking of conclusions and presenting what we did


Testing:
* ANOVA – check if the average percentage growth is different between the 4 quarters, and possibly the X holidays


Other trends to check:
* Analyze what happens on holidays
   * Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas
      * Spendy holidays: might expect Amazon, eCommerce type to do well
   * Near holidays (+/- the holiday if it’s closed)
* Seasonal differences
   * Are stocks more likely to go up in one season vs. the other?


Data Processing:
* Combining the data sets or find a way to call the columns of each stock


Analysis:
* (1) Is there a significant difference in stock performance during holidays vs. the rest of the year?
* (2) Is there a significant difference in stock performance between different quarters?
* (3) Is there a significant correlation between the stock price changes within the groups, and the overall market (S&P 500)?
   * Are the general same or different compared to the S&P 500?
      * Visual – comparing the bar graphs
      * Statistical tests – comparing the averages
   * If this true, maybe conclude that the overall market indicates the trends
   * If this is not true, maybe conclude that individual industries behave differently
* (Extra?) Are the changes in stock price correlated across industries (tech vs. cars)?


Time:
4 weeks
Week 1- get the proposal in, figure out what we want to do
Week 2- start writing the code (finish the code if possible)
Week 3- Analysis of the results
Week 4- Reports, recording, final touches.








Potential ideas: 
* Stocks
   * * Parking tickets
   * Prediction of parking tickets based on vehicle characteristics, categories, etc.
* Basketball
* Snake game (challenging)
* Sudoku solver
* tetris ???? (very challenging)
* Simulating enderman placing blocks within a certain boundary (haha)
* https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satayjit/student-performance-bd
   * Predictors of student performance
   * Parents’ education, city/area, gender, parent’s job
   * Linear regression?  Correlation?  


Ask about:
* What data can we get from tic tac toe to analyze/create analysis (visualization)
* What kind of hypothesis are you looking for in TTT?
